### What I really do ? 😌
  
  - I develop web/backend servers for web/android apps using `NodeJS` and `Flask`, and `MongoDB` as DB.
  - I also develop cross platform mobile apps using `React Native` and `React` Web apps.
  - I find great pleasure in mixing up tech stacks and especially while implementing ML/DL models to work with the clients and servers.
  - I find `LeetCode` as a great place to brush up my cognitive skills, for developing better apps, ovio.
  - I have basic knowledge of various ML/DL algos starting from basic `regression` models to deep learning algorithms like `CNNs`, `RNNs`, `Auto Encoders`, etc.
  - I have firm grip over languages like `Python`, `JavaScript` and `C++` (I use C++ for coding out algos).
  - I know to use and have used on multiple occasions packages like `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `SciPy`, `Scikit-Learn` and frameworks like `Tensorflow`

### My work that I have been Proud of ? 😎
  My work with [Juglr.fit](https://juglr.fit), Implementing the `Posenet` model on a react-native app with the help of `tfjs-react-native` was easy, no doubt. But, enhancing its performannce on a app, that runs on a single thread was challenging. Initial implementation got us 4-6 FPS on different category of mobile phones. Since, Posenet is heavy, it ate up the only thread to use hence leaving us with the performance issue with the UI/ UX as well as with the tracker. First of all, there was a bridge which we were using inside the app which also introduced certain delays. There was no one to guide us on app development and about improving its performances. After around 2 months of searching, we freed up the bridge saving us some time. But, we got a significant inprovement when I came across a package which frees up the UI thread and pushes the heavy tasks into a background thread. That helped us achieve about 10+ FPS on an average which was good enough for scaling to users. Unfortunately, the I was unable to scale the skeleton with the actual human body across all devices.
